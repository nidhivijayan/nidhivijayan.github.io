I taught MCB 2612 for 5 years. This was an incredibly fun class where students isolated bacteria from soil sample of their choice, and determined what it was using sequencing and determined their potentiial to produce antibiotics. 

I am very proud of my students from this class and I guess if I had to post this anywhere, it should be my website.

The comments I received from my students in my last class.
