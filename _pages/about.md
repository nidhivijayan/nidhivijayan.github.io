My name is Nidhi Vijayan and I’m currently a PhD candidate in Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of Connecticut. 

For my PhD, I primarily investigated the immune responses of two symbiotic organs within the Hawaiian bobtail squid: the light organ and a female-specific reproductive organ. The aim was to understand how the immune system manages diverse microbiomes in distinct organs. I analyzed their gene expressions and localized the host mRNA and proteins of interest, along with the bacteria (paper in progress). I also conducted 16S analysis of cephalopod microbiomes from different locations worldwide, involving collaboration with cephalopod biologists to obtain samples (paper published). 

Apart from my main projects, I was also involved in many collaborations. One such involved determining optimum method for single cell isolation of squid organs for single-cell transcriptomics (in collab with McFall-Ngai lab in CalTech). However, since my PhD is wrapping up, I won’t have the opportunity to continue this project further. I was also involved in NSF funded project to study bacteria in the squid egg environment as they produce antifungals and antibacterial compounds. I also collaborated with Simakov lab (U. of Vienna) to model and annotate Euprymna scolopes genome. Further we collaborated with the Balunas lab (U. of Michigan) and Angeles-Boza lab (UConn) to correlate the metabolome, metals, and microbiome in tunicates. Together, I have learnt the following skills may be useful in studying interactions of epithelia, microbiome, immune, and genetic factors:
•	Bulk/single-cell transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics
•	16S, metagenomics, metaproteomics
•	Confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence, fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques, histology
