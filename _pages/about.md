I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow specializing in host–microbiome interactions, with a focus on inflammatory disease models. My research integrates multi-omics data from large, complex datasets to understand how microbial communities and host immune responses shape disease outcomes. I bridge molecular biology and computational analysis, combining RNA-seq, 16S rRNA profiling, shotgun metagenomics, and imaging-based approaches to generate mechanistic insight from systems-level data.

Though I started my career with a focus in marine biology, I came to realize my interest lies with the overarching focus of how animals and bacteria interact with each other. Our gut is home to many species of microbes. Our body's immune system selects for them and keeps this ecosystem in check, and in turn, the microbiome provides the host with numerous benefits. Thus it is often compared to a garden. Disruption of this balance, whether through the emergence of pathogenic “weeds” or external stressors that impair immune regulation, can lead to inflammation and disease. I am interested in understanding how this dynamic equilibrium is established and maintained, with the goal of identifying strategies to restore microbial balance and ultimately prevent or mitigate inflammatory disease.

Through my experiences, multi-tasking on various projects with collaborators, I have the following skills:

- Bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics  
- 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics, metaproteomics  
- Confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
